Open Source School App Example

This project is an example of an Android App for use by a school for displaying basic information about teachers, staff, and school policies. It was made using Buzztouch, a free app development website, that allows a user to keep the code produced to make their app.

Here I have put all the files needed to run an app for a school, minus the secret keys for my buzztouch stuff. You can see how the data is formatted in JSON, and how each screen just calls their display data from that. It can be used entirely offline by removing the reporting and data urls from the BT_config.txt file.

Feel free to take this, and aask questions if you would like to do one of these for your school.

THe iOS version of this is not open source, but free on the app store so you can see how it looks. https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cpma-ms/id475251055?mt=8
